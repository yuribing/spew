# Creat new repository inside your github

# add git function inside your local project
##    git init
##    - then you can see the new .git folder showed up in your folder. Behold, you can not see in VS code. Only from your explore.

# add your new files
##  git add tricks2.txt

# make first commit
##  git commit -m "first commit"    
##  - so now, it's in commit phase to be ready for upload(push) to your Github site.

# make a new branch (main) and point to it
##  git branch -M main

# Set your remote, you don't need to set once it's done
##  git remote add origin https://github.com/yuribing/spew.git

# push (upload) your local branch, which is currently main, to your Github site. "origin" means your Github, "main" is your Github site main branch. so it's local branch to remote branch.
##  git push -u origin main

DONE! Good luck!
